## Overview

`Add-UsersFromCSVToGroup.ps1` is a PowerShell script that automates the process of adding multiple users to an Active Directory group. It reads user IDs from a CSV file, appends a defined domain suffix to create UPNs, verifies each user in AD, checks their membership, and adds them to the specified group only if not already present.
